# testing markdown

_let's see if we can
span lines with italics - yes?
yes_

*does the underscore
work different than the asterisk? - no*

_# headings? - nope, not inside the italics brackets_

*but after 
## a line break heading format over-rides the italics?
text looks like italics in edit mode, but not in reading mode


### hmmm ... _inside a heading italics can be added_

%% aha we put comments here %%
